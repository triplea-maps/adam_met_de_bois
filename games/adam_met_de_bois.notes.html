<b>Scenario</b><br>
Amsterdam is te klein voor deze groep bois.<br>
Een 7-zijdige oorlog breekt uit.<br>
Diegene die thuiswijken van andere bois weet te veroveren is de erkende koning.<br>
<br><br>

<b>NB: Special rules</b><br>
Airplane and airbase construction is mostly restricted to Schiphol airport to give extra importance to the region. <br>
The only places were airbase and airplane construction are possible are: <br>
-Baan 04 <br>
-Baan 27 <br>
-Baan 36 C <br>
-Baan 36 en 06 <br>
-Schiphol Terminal <br>
-Schiphol zuid <br>
-Zuiderwolde <br>
-Natuurgebied Naardermeer <br>
-Flevoland <br>
-Lustoord <br>
-Zwanenburg <br>
Harbours are restricted to the existing ones exept Zuiderwolde where an additional one can be constructed. <br>
Keep in mind that factory construction is always limited to territories with a value higher than 1. <br>
Both harbours and airfields cost 50 PU's to construct. This keeps the existing ones valueable. <br>
Note that the construction of airplanes requires both a factory and an airfield to be present in the tile. <br>
The same holds true for ships and harbours. <br>
